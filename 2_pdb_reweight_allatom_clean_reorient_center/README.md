Nomenclature of our Example IDs

Our example IDs contain three fields separated by underscore characters.  The first field refers to the PDBid of the structure from which the example was taken.  The second field refers to the distinct entity of the aforementioned PDB structure from which the example was taken. The third field refers to the index of the first amino acid residue present in the example, not counting any missing/unmodeled residues in the PDB structure from which it was taken.
